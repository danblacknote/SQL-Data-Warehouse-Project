* Project Requirements

 Building Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

  Objectives
  
Develop a Modern Data Warehouse Using SQL to consolidate sales data, enabling
analytical reporting and informed decision-making.


  Specification

  . Data Source: Import data from two different sources (CRM and ERP) provided as CSV file
  . Data Quality: Clean, resolve, and  transform data quality issues before analytics 
  . Integration: Combine both sources into a single user-friendly data model designed for analytics
  . Scopr: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is or required 
  . Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both stakeholders and the analytics team


  
Data Architeture 

. Bronze Layer: Extract data from the source in row form. Data is ingested in CSV format into the SQL Database
. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleaning, transforming, standardization, and normalization to prepare data 
for analytics 
. Gold Layer: It contains a business-ready data model in a star schema required for analytics and reporting
